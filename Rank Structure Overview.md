The Stateview Rank Structure Overview outline important information and regulations reguarding ranks at our correctional facility. By following these detailed instructions, our staff can maintain high standards of operation and ensure a smooth gameplay experience that aligns with our facilityâ€™s protocols and expectations.

# **Rank Limits**
* Rank Limits are the numerical restriction on ranks. For example, if Facility Director has a rank limit of 90, only up to 90 users can have the Facility Director rank. Rank Limits do not consider authorities or users who have purchased their rank.

# **Rank Cooldowns**
* CAO-W: Cooldowns are the time a user must wait between session promotions. For example, if a user got Deputy Warden to Warden from a session 6 days ago, that user has one day left of cooldown as the Warden cooldown is 7 days.
* SI+: Cooldowns are the time a user must wait before being eligible for a promotion to Chairperson+. For example, if a user got Warden to Superintendent 6 days ago, that user has one day left of cooldown as the Superintendent cooldown is 7 days.

# **Rank Quota**
* Session Quota: Session quota comes in the form of session and supervision points. Session points are the total times a user has hosted and co-hosted a session each week.
* Minute Quota: Minutes are the total amount of time a user has played Stateview that week, determined by the "Total Week Playtime" statistics (not including AFK time). Each rank has a certain amount of minutes required to be played each week.
* Failure to fully complete quota will result in receiving a Staff Warning. Users who are excused from quota for that week will not receive punishment. Quota goes from Monday 12:00 AM to Sunday 12:00 PM in your local timezone.

# **Rank Permissions**

Each rank has certain permissions and abilities that outline what they can do, what they can't do, what requires approval, and more. These permissions are outlined in any guidelines that may be related. For example, what rank can host a training would be outlined in the training guide.

---

# **Authority Information**

Users can be granted the "authority" of a rank. Authorities give users some qualities of a rank; however, they do not possess the rank in the Stateview group itself.

### **Qualities of Authorities Include:**
* Associated Discord Role
* Hosting Permissions
* Co-Hosting Permissions
* Helper Permissions
* Supervisor Permissions
* Issuing Promotions
* Punishments (Modifying/Types/Approval/Approving/Etc)
* Granting Approval

### **Qualities of Authorities Do Not Include:**
* Quota
* Promotions
  * Example: If a Facility Director with Chairman of the Board authority got promoted, they would get promoted from Facility Director to Community Advisory Council and not from Chairman of the Board to Chief Executive Officer.
* Statistics 
  * Example: Facility Director+ is authorized to host trainings. If a Chairperson has the authority of a Facility Director, any trainings they hosted could not be considered in promotion statistics, along with any other statistics their actual rank could not obtain.
* Resigning
  * Example: Prison Commissioner+ is required to resign to Respected Inmate. So if a Facility Director has Prison Commissioner authority, they would be ineligible to resign to Respected Inmate.
  * You may ask whoever granted your authority (or someone similar to who granted it) to revoke your authority. This is similar to a resignation but with no restrictions and for authorities instead.
* Anything Not Listed In The Including Section

### **Extra Information:**
* You cannot punish users with a higher authority than your authority.
* You cannot punish users with a higher rank than your authority.
* Governor Administration is considered an authority. However, users with this authority are fully excused from quota.
