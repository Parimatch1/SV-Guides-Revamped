# **Rank Limits**
* Rank Limits are the numerical restriction on ranks. For example, if Facility Director has a rank limit of 90, only up to 90 users can have the Facility Director rank. Rank Limits do not consider authorities or users who have purchased their rank.

# **Rank Cooldowns**
* CAO-W: Cooldowns are the time a user must wait between session promotions. For example, if a user got Deputy Warden to Warden from a session 6 days ago, that user has one day left of cooldown as the Warden cooldown is 7 days.
* SI+: Cooldowns are the time a user must wait before being eligible for a promotion to Chairperson+. For example, if a user got Warden to Superintendent 6 days ago, that user has one day left of cooldown as the Superintendent cooldown is 7 days.

# **Rank Quota**
* Session Quota: Session quota comes in the form of session and supervision points. Session points are the total times a user has hosted and co-hosted a session each week.
* Minute Quota: Minutes are the total amount of time a user has played Stateview that week, determined by the "Total Week Playtime" statistics (not including AFK time). Each rank has a certain amount of minutes required to be played each week.
* Failure to fully complete quota will result in receiving a Staff Warning. Users who are excused from quota for that week will not receive punishment. Quota goes from Monday 12:00 AM to Sunday 12:00 PM in your local timezone.

# **Rank Permissions**

Each rank has certain permissions and abilities that outline what they can do, what they can't do, what requires approval, and more. These permissions are outlined in any guidelines that may be related. For example what rank can host a training would be outlined in the training guide.

---

# **Authority Information**

Users can be granted the "authority" of a rank. Which means you would not get the rank in the group, but would still obtain some of it's qualities.

### **Some qualities include:**
* Associated Discord Role
* Hosting Permissions
* Co-Hosting Permissions
* Helper Permissions
* Supervisor Permissions
* Issuing Promotions
* Punishments (Modifying/Types/Approval/Approving/Etc)
* Granting Approval

### **And Does Not Include:**
* Quota
* Promotions
  * Example: If a FD with CMoTB authority got promoted, they would get promoted FD-CAC and not CMoTB-CEO.
* Statistics 
  * Example: FD+ can host trainings, so if a CP has FD authority any training hosts could not be considered in promotions, along with other statistics their actual rank could not obtain.
* Resigning
  * Example: PC+ is required to get RI. So if a FD has PC authority they would not be eligble to resign to RI.
  * You may ask whoever granted your authority (or someone similar to who granted it) to revoke your authority. Similar to a resignation but with no restrictions and for authorities instead.
* Anything Not Listed In The Including Section

### **Extra Information:**
* You cannot punish users with a higher authority than your authority.
* You cannot punish users with a higher rank than your authority.
* You can punish users with a rank lower than your authority.
* Governor Administration is considered an authority. However, users with this authority are fully excused from quota.
