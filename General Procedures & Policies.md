# **Enforcement Information**
* Intelligence Agents, Community Management Associates, Executive Committee Associates, and Chief of Staff+ have the authority to punish users for the rules in this guide.
* Invalid punishments issued by Community Management should be reported to Community Management Management.
* Invalid punishments issued by Intelligence Agency should be reported to Intelligence Agency High Command.
* Invalid punishments issued by Executive Committee should be reported to Executive Committee High Command.
* Invalid punishments issued by Chief of Staff+ should be reported to the Support Agency.
* Chief of Staff+ can revert punishments not issued under a department if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ and all departements authorized to punish under this guide can modify punishments if they have a valid reason. Modification factors include:
  * The impact on Stateview's daily operation.
  * The surrounding circumstances of the incident.
  * The nature and severity of the behavior(s) in question.
  * Instances of past or ongoing patterns of behavior.
  * The relationships between the parties involved.
  * The broader context in which the alleged incidents occurred.
* Modified punishments do count towards that type of infraction (Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.).  
  * Example: If someone gets a modified ban of 7 days and it is their first ban, the second ban should still be 3 days (the standard length of a users second ban).
* Modified punishments do count towards that rules infraction count. 
  * Example: If someone gets a modified tool ban for first infraction tool abuse, the next tool abuse punishment would be their second infraction and would be punished with the second infraction punishment.
* Improper/Invalid punishments do not count towards normal infractions or infraction types (Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.).  
  * If the previous punishment a user recieved for a certain rule is either reverted for being invalid or clearly invalid you are expected to treat it as invalid.
  * Invalid punishments should be reported to the Intelligence Agency once noticed if they are not yet reverted.
  * Example: This means if someone gets an unmodified punishment of a tool ban for a tool abuse first infraction (which is incorrect), you would ignore that punishment and issue the proper punishment for tool abuse first infraction.
* Kicks, Server Bans, and Team Bans should be logged on Bloxcord as a comment.  
  * Example: Team banned for Tool Abuse (Fourth Infraction)
* You must log on Bloxcord and in Intel with your department unless you are punishing independently as an FD+.  
  * Example: Bypassing LOA (First Infraction) || SVCM
* If logged on Bloxcord under a department, the punishment is no longer under the authority of IA but instead that department's high command.
* All ranks and departments are required to log punishments with valid proof.
* Chief of Staff+ and all departements authorized to punish under this guide can make punishments unappealable if they have a valid reason.
* Branch Diversity Team+ and all departements authorized to punish under this guide can classify the reason and/or proof for a punishment if they have a valid reason.
* If a user is demoted, suspended, or terminated, a rank-lock for the same length must be issued.
* For terminations, a permanent suspension must be issued instead of manually ranking to SSI.
* Rank Locks only prevent rank claiming but do not prevent session promotions.
* LTAP punishments do not count towards a user's game ban infractions.
* Verbal Warnings, Kicks, Server Bans, and 5 Minute Game Bans can not be appealed.
* Reverted punishments that are not invalid still count towards a users rule infraction count and the punishment infraction count.
* Users who break rules are entitled to know the reason and length of their punishment. They can also see the proof related to their punishment so long it does not contain classified material they do not have access to.
* Users are allowed to share the type, reason, and length of their punishment unless told otherwise.
* Chief of Staff+ have the authority to punish under "logical rules". Rules that don't officially exist but are logically rules. Things that are logically not allowed but aren't officially against the rules.
* Precedents: If something has been clearly shown time and time again to be an unofficial official rule a "precedent" has been set. It becomes justifiable for more circumstances surrounding the infraction to open up. Like who can punish for it, what the specific definition is, etc.

# **I - Reform Strategy & Initiatives**

* Reforms are designed to uphold the activity, maturity, and professionalism standards of our high ranking users. In order to uphold these values we have decided to introduce a reform initiative policy. This policy aims to ensure these expectations are met and to reform members who do not meet our standards.

The following reforms outline the new ranks that reformed members will receive:
> Chief of Staff-Chairman of the Board --> Board of Governors
> Community Advisory Council-Board of Governors --> Facility Director
> Chairperson-Facility Director --> Superintendent
> 
> Members can be issued a staff warning instead of being fully reformed.

The following factors listed below are what will be considered during the reform process:
> In-Game Activity
> Discord Activity
> Respect and Maturity
> Organizational Impact
> Community Rating

### **Additional Information**
* Members who have purchased ranks or any form of quota excusal will still be subject to reforms when they occur. Forms of quota excusal will be taken into account during the reform process.
* You have the chance to appeal your reform within 72 hours of notice. Appeals must be well-thought-out and provide supporting evidence to show that you meet enough factors to not be reformed.
  * Even upon appeal you may receive a rank lower then what you previously had.
