# **Information**
### **Information**
* Any group chats that involve promotion discussions must have a Chief of Staff+ present.
* Once invited to provide your feedback on a promotion, you cannot steal that promotion for yourself or for others.
* Factors of Determination can slightly make up for a lack of statistics.
* Everyone who agreed to the promotion must be listed on the promotion log. They must be listed in order of most work to least work done for the promotion. The user who had the idea for the promotion always is listed first.
* Only the statistics from the user's current rank should be considered in a promotion.
* Be sure to check a user's statistics through the administration server.
* When someone is promoted, you should allow them to get their own roles in both servers.
* Invalid punishments should not be considered in the "History" section of a promotion. All other punishments (even reverted ones) do count.
* Statistics reset upon a demotion, termination, or blacklist. Statistics will unreset if the punishment is reverted.
* Your statistics are not affected if your promotion gets reverted. However, any statistics you earned with your new rank before losing it will not be counted.
* Statistics permanently reset upon your resignation.
* Users have the choice to decline their promotion.
