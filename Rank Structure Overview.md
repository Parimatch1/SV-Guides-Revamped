The Stateview Rank Structure Overview outline important information and regulations reguarding ranks at our correctional facility. By following these detailed instructions, our staff can maintain high standards of operation and ensure a smooth gameplay experience that aligns with our facilityâ€™s protocols and expectations.

# **Rank Limits**
* Rank Limits is the numerical restriction on ranks. For example, if Facility Director has a rank limit of 50, only up to 50 users can have the Facility Director rank. Rank Limits do not consider users who have purchased their rank.

# **Rank Cooldowns**
* Cooldowns are the time a user must wait between session promotions. For example, if a user got Deputy Warden-Warden from a session 6 days ago, but the Warden cooldown is 7 days, that user has one day left of cooldown.

# **Rank Quota**
* Each rank above Chairperson has 2 forms of quota. The first form is session and supervision points. Session points are the total time a user has hosted and co-hosted a session each week. The second form of quota is minutes. Minutes are the total amount of time a user has played Stateview that week, and is determined by the "Total Week Playtime" statistic (minus afk time). Failure to fully complete quota will result in a Staff Warning unless you have quota excusal for that week. Quota goes from Monday 12:00AM to Sunday 12:00PM in your local timezone.

# **Rank Permissions**

Each rank has certain permissions and abilities that outline what they can do, what they can't do, what requires approval, and more. These permissions are outlined in any guidelines that may be related. For example what rank can host a training would be outlined in the training guide.

---

# **Authority Information**

Users can be granted the "authority" of a rank. Which means you would not get the rank in the group, but would still obtain some of it's qualities.

### **Some qualities include:**
* Associated Discord Role
* Hosting Permissions
* Co-Hosting Permissions
* Helper Permissions
* Supervisor Permissions
* Promotions
* Punishments
* Granting Approval

### **And Does Not Include:**
* Quota
* Promotions
  * Example: If a FD with CMoTB authority got promoted, they would get promoted FD-CAC and not CMoTB-CEO.
* Statistics 
  * Example: FD+ can host trainings, so if a CP has FD authority any training hosts could not be considered in promotions, along with other statistics their actual rank could not obtain.
* Resigning
  * Example: PC+ is required to get RI. So if a FD has PC authority they would not be eligble to resign to RI.
  * You may ask whoever granted your authority (or someone similar to who granted it) to revoke your authority. Similar to a resignation but with no restrictions and for authorities instead.
* Anything Not Listed In The Including Section

### **Extra Information:**
* You cannot punish users with a higher authority than your authority.
* You cannot punish users with a higher rank than your authority.
* You can punish users with a rank lower than your authority.
* Governor Administration is considered an authority. However, users with this authority are fully excused from quota.
