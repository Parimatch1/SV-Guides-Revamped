h There is a session currently ongoing outside of the session room. Raiding it will result in punishment.

Your task here is simple, you will be called up to the yard pair by pair to 1v1 each other.

I will place you in specific starting positions. Do not move from these positions until you see me say "FIRE!".

Once complete you will go STS facing the grass on concrete area just before the grass.

Any questions? Yes/No, [Rank].

If you wish to pair up with someone step forward and stand next to eachother. Make it clear you are a pair.

If you do not wish to pair up then I will pair you myself. Then we will begin the 1v1s once everyone is paired.

> `[Pair up those without a partner]`
> `[If there is an uneven amount of attendees a session admin or spectator can step in to 1v1. You can also make an attendee who won go again with them]`

> `[Place pairs diagonally from eachother in the grass part of the max yard]`
