* Factors of Determination can slighty make up for a lack of statistics.
* Everyone who agreed to the promotion must be listed on the promotion log. They must be listed in order of most work to least work done for the promotion.
* Only the statistics from the users current rank should be considered in a promotion.
* Be sure to check a users statistics through the administration server.
* When someone is promoted you should allow them to get their own roles in both servers.
* Invalid punishments should not be considered in the "History" section of a promotion. All other punishments (even reverted ones) do count.
* Statistics reset upon a demotion, termination, or blacklist. Statistics will unreset if the punishment is reverted.
