# **Enforcement Information**
* Game Administrators, Support Agents, and Facility Director+ have the authority to punish users for the rules in this guide.
* Invalid punishments issued by Game Administration should be reported to Game Administration Management.
* Invalid punishments issued by Support Agency should be reported to Support Agency High Command.
* Invalid punishments issued by Facility Director+ should be reported to the Intelligence Agency.
* Chief of Staff+ can revert punishments not issued under a department if they have a valid reason. A report to the Intelligence Agency is also mandatory if the punishment is invalid.
* Chief of Staff+ can modify punishments if they have a valid reason. Modification factors include:
  * The impact on Stateview's daily operation.
  * The surrounding circumstances of the incident.
  * The nature and severity of the behavior(s) in question.
  * Instances of past or ongoing patterns of behavior.
  * The relationships between the parties involved.
  * The broader context in which the alleged incidents occurred.
* Modified punishments do count towards that type of infraction (Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.).  
  * Example: If someone gets a modified ban of 7 days and it is their first ban, the second ban should still be 3 days (the standard length of a users second ban).
* Modified punishments do count towards that rules infraction count. 
  * Example: If someone gets a modified tool ban for first infraction tool abuse, the next tool abuse punishment would be their second infraction and would be punished with the second infraction punishment.
* Improper/Invalid punishments do not count towards normal infractions or infraction types (Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.).  
  * If the previous punishment a user recieved for a certain rule is either reverted for being invalid or clearly invalid you are expected to treat it as invalid.
  * Invalid punishments should be reported to the Intelligence Agency once noticed if they are not yet reverted.
  * Example: This means if someone gets an unmodified punishment of a tool ban for a tool abuse first infraction (which is incorrect), you would ignore that punishment and issue the proper punishment for tool abuse first infraction.
* Kicks, Server Bans, and Team Bans should be logged on Bloxcord as a comment.  
  * Example: Team banned for Tool Abuse (Fourth Infraction)
* You must log on Bloxcord and in Intel with your department unless you are punishing independently as an FD+.  
  * Example: Tool Abuse (First Infraction) || SVGA
* If logged on Bloxcord under a department, the punishment is no longer under the authority of IA but instead that department's high command.
* All ranks and departments are required to log punishments. However, Chief of Staff+ and Game Administration Operations Executive+ (When Logging Under SVGA) are exempt from the proof requirement. Note that not adding proof may make appealing the violation easier.
  * Proof is required for blacklists.
* Chief of Staff+ can make punishments unappealable if they have a valid reason.
* Branch Diversity Team+ can classify the reason and/or proof for a punishment if they have a valid reason.
* If a user is demoted, suspended, or terminated, a rank-lock for the same length must be issued.
* For terminations, a permanent suspension must be issued instead of manually ranking to SSI.
* Rank Locks only prevent rank claiming but do not prevent session promotions.
* LTAP punishments do not count towards a user's game ban infractions.
* In the event that you do not have the authority to issue a punishment on a user, contact a user who does or create a report.
* Verbal Warnings, Kicks, Server Bans, and 5 Minute Game Bans can not be appealed.
* Reverted punishments that are not invalid still count towards a users rule infraction count and the punishment infraction count.
* Users who recieve punishments are entitled to know the reason and length of their punishment. They can also see the proof related to their punishment so long it does not contain classified material.
* Users are allowed to share the type, reason, and length of their punishment unless told otherwise.
* Community Advisory Council+ can issue blacklists. However, Board of Governors+ permission is required to issue a blacklist.
* Community Advisory Council+ can demote, suspend, and terminate users. However, Prison Commissioner+ permission is required to issue these punishments.
* You have up to one hour to log a punishment. Users who are occupied with a session will have extended time so long they log it asap. It is highly recommended that (unless your busy with a session) you log asap.
  * You are required to add BC comments for in-game punishments within five minutes of them being issued to ensure infractions are properly counted.
