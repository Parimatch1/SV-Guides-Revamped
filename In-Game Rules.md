# **Moderation Information**
* Game Administrators, Support Agents, and Facility Director+ have the authority to punish users for the rules in this guide.  
* Certain Game Administration members can revert punishments issued by Game Administration if they have a valid reason.  
* Certain Support Agency members can revert punishments issued by Support Agency if they have a valid reason.  
* Board of Governors+ can revert punishments not issued under a department if they have a valid reason. A report to the intelligence agency is also mandatory.
* Community Advisory Council+ can issue blacklists. However, Board of Governors+ permission is required to issue a blacklist.
* Chief of Staff+ and the Intelligence Agency can modify punishments if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ and the Intelligence Agency can make punishments unappealable if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ and the Intelligence Agency can classify the reason and/or proof for a punishment if they have a valid reason.
* All ranks are required to log punishments. However, Chief of Staff+ are exempt from the proof requirement. Note that not adding proof may make appealing the violation easier.
* Mutes, Staff Warnings, Tool Bans, Game Bans [Excluding 5 Minute Ones], Rank Locks, Modcall Bans, Suspensions, Demotions, and Terminations can be appealed.
* In the event that you do not have the authority to impose a punishment on a user, contact a user who does or create a report.
* Modified punishments do count towards that type of infraction [Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.].  
  * Example: This means if someone gets a modified ban of 7 days and it is their first ban, the second ban should still be 3 days.
* Improper/Invalid punishments do not count towards normal infractions or infraction types [Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.].  
  * Even if the punishment is not yet reverted, this still applies. However, you are not required to ensure past punishments are correct, just as long as your punishment is correct based on the last correct punishment.
  * Invalid punishments should be reported to the Intelligence Agency once noticed if they are not reverted.
  * Example: This means if someone gets an unmodified punishment of a server ban for a tool abuse first infraction, you would ignore that punishment and issue a verbal warning for a tool abuse first infraction.
* LTAP punishments do not count towards a user's game ban infractions.
* If a user is demoted, suspended, or terminated, a rank-lock for the same length must be issued.  
* For terminations, a permanent suspension must be issued instead of manually ranking to SSI.  
* Rank locks only prevent rank claiming but do not prevent session promotions.
* Kicks, server bans, and team bans should be logged on Bloxcord as a comment.  
  * Example: Team banned for tool abuse (Fourth Infraction).  
* You must log on Bloxcord and in Intel with your department unless you are punishing independently as an FD+.  
  * Example: Tool abuse (First Infraction) || SVGA.  
* If logged on Bloxcord under a department, the punishment is no longer under the authority of IA but instead that department's high command.
* Reverted punishments that are not invalid still count towards the infraction count and the punishment infraction count.
