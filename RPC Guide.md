# **Information & Roles**
**Host:** Please listen carefully, as I briefly explain this session in detail.

**Host:** Riot Protocols are sessions where criminals are to breach a checkpoint, and officers are to stop them while staying within the grounds of the facility.

**Host:** The teams will be split up equally, and the two helpers will be the captain of one of the listed teams. You are to refer to the captain for instruction/questions.

**Host:** You will have 6 minutes each round. If the criminals breach one of the listed checkpoints, they will win. However, if none of the criminals get to a checkpoint, the officers will win.

**Host:** There are three checkpoints: Maximum Security Yard, High-Command Offices, and Solitary/Maximum Security Cellblock. Teams will either defend or breach that area to win.

**Host:** Please listen carefully as I will now be going over the description of each role. You will be assigned roles shortly.

**Host:** Response Team - Guards the facility, answers to any panic calls, watches over checkpoints, and ensures there are no breaches.

**Host:** Criminal Team - Will breach the facility, and enter into a checkpoint zone.

**Host:** Before we proceed, you are required to listen to your captain. No exceptions. Both teams are to coordinate with each other on their own team, planning ahead before the riot.

**Host:** We ask that everyone listens for in-game announcements. Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action.

**Host:** Before we begin, my co-host will now assign you roles. Please listen carefully, as your role will depend upon what you will be doing for the duration of the session.

> `[The co-host should split the session equally, either right down the middle or by front and back rows.]`
> `[Once the teams are created move the 2 teams to the opposite green lines on either side of the session room]`
> `[After splitting the teams move people around to make the teams even]`
> `[Each helper will be assigned a team as the captain. If there are not enough helpers, pick a co-host to be the captain.]`

**Host:** Does everyone understand what their roles are?

**Host:** The members selected to be criminals, will be teamed momentarily. We ask that you stay at the criminal spawn when you are respawned. Then wait for further instructions.

> `[The session supervisor and any CAC+ can team and respawn or kill the criminals. The criminal captain should be respawned/killed first]`
> `[During this time the response team should begin planning]`

**Host:** m Criminals, please stay at the criminal spawn until given authorization to do otherwise. Please obey the captain's instructions.

**Host:** pm `[Criminal Captain]` You are expected to coordinate with your team, on how you are going to breach the facility and reach the checkpoint.
