# **Session Information**

> `[At this time the fugitives (helpers) should begin heading to their hiding spots]`

**Host:**
This Fugitive Recovery Protocol will work almost opposite to a standard riot-protocol.

Your goal is to recover the Fugitives, they are somewhere around the map and are actively trying to evade capture!

You cannot use lethal force on the fugitives. You must chase them down and detain them. However, the fugitives are armed and are likely to shoot at you.

Once the Fugitives are successfully detained, you should bring them back to the Session Room. The fugitives may try to escape until they are brought to the Session Room.

You are not allowed to make use of cars when returning fugitives. Additionally, you may be intercepted while returning the fugitives.

You will periodically be given hints in order to aid fugitive capture. Use these hints wisely and act on them quickly.

Upon dismissal, please make use of a car. It is recommended to team up with another officer to aid the capture of the fugitives.

Communication is expected during this session. Please use radio channel two to update fellow officers on your status.

While communicating, please use the following format: [Rank] Message. For example: [CP] Patrolling village.

Ensure to keep track of the radio signal during the session as you may loose it while traveling across the map.

`[You may hold the attendees for a little to give the fugitives more hiding time]:`
* Please wait for the fugitives to finish hiding. At this time please ask any questions you may have.

`[Wait for the fugitives to finish hiding]`
