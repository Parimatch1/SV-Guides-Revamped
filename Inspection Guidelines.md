**Speaker:** 
We ask that everybody switch to radio channel 2 for the remainder of the inspection. This can be done by clicking the "1" in the top right of the radio.

We are now moving on to procedures & comprehension correctness. In this phase, I’ll be testing you on your grammar and knowledge skills.

While I explain, my co-host will private message you all a '-' as this phase consists of questions. Do not open this private message until you are ready to answer the current question.

> `[The user who is doing questions should go around and PM each attendee a '-' while the host is talking]`

**Speaker:**
Next, we will be going over key procedures/correctness skills you must demonstrate as you would on a regular basis during a Stateview shift.

You will all be given one of the following posts: Scout, Patrol, or Captain.

If you are given the role of scout, you will be in charge of patrolling the outer walls of the prison, and communicating with staff inside the prison in regards to raiders/escapees.

If you are given the role of patrol, you will be in charge of patrolling the prison and maintaining control of the current status of the prison.

If you are given the role of captain, you are in charge of your assigned team, making sure both teams are working together properly and leading both teams during the drills.

This phase will last for 15 minutes, during which you must maintain the responsibilities of your role. My co-host will now assign the roles.
﻿
> `[Max 1 Captain per team ranked Chairperson+]`
> `[Co-Host assigns roles]`

**Speaker:**
Does everybody have a role? Yes/No, [Rank].

During this section, you will undergo a Lockdown drill and Blackout drill which you must engage with in order to pass this section.

Before we dismiss you, we’d like to go over a few expectations that we expect, in addition to information that will assist you.

Lockdown Drill: When the Lockdown drill begins, attendees must move all inmates into their cells. Ensure that everyone is within the cell-block during the Lockdown.

Blackout Drill: During the Blackout, the power will be turned off. Guards and inmates are required to remain in the cellblock until the procedure concludes. Do not restore the power during this time.

Throughout this phase, you will receive private messages for questions; the questions can be found on radio channel 3 and should be answered in the private message.

Before we dismiss you, we’d like to go over a few expectations that we expect, in addition to information that will assist you.

I - You are required to communicate.

II - When communicating on the radio, use the format: [Role] (Text). Example: [Scout] Cell Block is clear!

III - Please, remember NOT to keep doors open and NOT to use lethal force unnecessarily.

IV - You will be asked questions about the drill or your role in a private-message. You must answer these questions with grammar to the best of your ability.

Without further ado, you are dismissed to your roles.

`If the Host is doing this section, say the following:`

**Speaker:** 
We are now moving on to simulation tactics. In this section, we are testing you over your ability to not only listen to instructions, but to carry out two successful tactics to secure the prison.

The following phase will be detailed and described to you next.

We’ll now begin with a wedge formation where all of you will be placed somewhere in the session room in a wedge with your shields out.

Then you’ll be focused on the Sessions Room door, this is being done in case there’s Criminals planning to breach the Sessions Room.

I’ll now explain wedge formation for those that do not know.

Wedge Formation - The Host will be the head, all the attendees should form an arrow or a V formation like birds flying in the sky.

Does everyone understand what to do? Yes/No, [Rank].

Everyone, form a wedge formation on me with your shields out.

Spam a #!

`[Take a screenshot containing the host, co-host(s), helper(s), supervisor, and all attendees with usernames visible]`

Alright! Go back to STS.

Moving onto the next formation, we’ll be practicing to keep criminals away from the yard.

We’ll be in a SFL [Single File Line] and once we arrive at the yard gate we’ll move into a STS (Shoulder To Shoulder) line on the farthest white-line.

The aim of doing this is to make sure that the yard can be secured as it is a place where a lot of raiders are able to easily take over, and help other prisoners escape.

If you do not understand this section please give us a shout using the PTS system so we can ensure everyone is on the same page and that everyone knows what to do.

Does everyone understand what to do? Yes/No, [Rank].

Please make a single-file line behind me. Once we arrive at the yard, enter the Yard Formation.

`[Go to the yard and enter yard formation upon arriving]`

Spam a #!

`[Take a screenshot containing the host, co-host(s), helper(s), supervisor, and all attendees with usernames visible]`

Alright! Everyone stay where you are.

Your task here is simple, you will be called up one by one and your aim is to taze the moving target! You have 3 tries to hit the target. Please remain in a straight line until you are called up.

If it is not your turn, your tools must stay away. If you equip any tools, we may assume you are trying to cheat, and you may be dismissed.

Once complete you will go STS on the other white line by the yard gate.

Understood? Yes/No, [Rank].
