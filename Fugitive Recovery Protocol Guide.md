# **Session Information**

**Host:**
Please listen carefully, as I briefly explain this session in detail.

`[At this time the fugitives should begin heading to their hiding spots]`

Your goal is to recover the Fugitives, they are somewhere in or around the city or village, and are hiding!

To aid fugitive capture, you will be given hints periodically as to where they might be.

You cannot use lethal force on the fugitives. You need to chase them down and detain them. Note that the fugitives might shoot at you.

Once you have captured a fugitive bring them back to the Session Room and state that they have been captured in the radio.

Please use this format when communicating in the radio: [Car Members] Message. For example: [teddy/op] Fugitive in sight.

Please switch to radio channel 2. You can do this by clicking the "1" in the top right of the radio. Remain on this radio channel for the remainder of the session.

If you get split with the person who you were paired with, you may either spawn a new car and find them or ask them to pick you up.

Before I dismiss you, I will give you 60 seconds to find a partner. You must remain with this partner for the duration of the session.

`[Wait 60 Seconds]`

srlock dismissed.

m You may now begin hunting down the fugitives. Good luck!

`[Wait for a fugitive to be captured]`

m The first fugitive has been captured. One remains.

`[Wait for the remaining fugitive(s) to be captured]`
