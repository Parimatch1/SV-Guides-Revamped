# **Session Information**

**Host:**
Please listen carefully, as I briefly explain this session in detail.

`[At this time the fugitives should begin heading to their hiding spots]`

Your goal is to recover the Fugitives, they are somewhere in or around the city or village, and are hiding!

To aid fugitive capture, you will be given hints periodically as to where they might be.

You cannot use lethal force on the fugitives. You need to chase them down and detain them. Note that the fugitives might shoot at you.

Once you have captured a fugitive bring them back to the Session Room and state that they have been captured in the radio. 

You are required to walk when returning a fugitive. During your walk you may be attacked and shot at in an attempt to halt your recovery.

Periodically you will be given hints as to where the fugitive is. These hints will help you find them.

Each fugitive will be assigned a number to help you know which one is which.

Please use this format when communicating in the radio: [Car Members] Message. For example: [teddy/op] Fugitive in sight.

Please switch to radio channel 2. You can do this by clicking the "1" in the top right of the radio. Remain on this radio channel for the remainder of the session.

If you get split with the person who you were paired with, you may either spawn a new car and find them or ask them to pick you up.

Before I dismiss you, I will give you 60 seconds to find a partner and for the fugitives to finish hiding. You can change partners or go solo if you feel like it.

`[Wait 60 Seconds]`

srlock dismissed.

m You may now begin hunting down the fugitives. Good luck!

`[Give hints out as needed]`
`[You do have flexability with announcements h/m/sm]`

`[Wait for a fugitive to be captured]`

m Fugitive number # has been captured! Help secure the capture.

`[Wait for a fugitive to be captured and returned to the SR]`

m Fugitive number # has been captured and secured! # fugitives remain.

`[Wait for the remaining fugitive(s) to be captured and returned to the SR]`
