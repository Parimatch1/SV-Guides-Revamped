We are now moving on to room clearing. In this phase, I’ll be testing you on your clearing skills and facility knowledge.

Please create a single-file line behind me at the session room door. Once you are in the line, remain in place until given further instruction.

> `[Head over to the door and have attendees line up behind you] `
> `[Put 1 "Captain" on each side of the door]`

Please split into two even lines on each side of the door. Go behind the "Captains".

> `[Equally split the attendees into 2 lines and place them on both sides of the door]`
> `[Once the lines are made move to the center of the lines so everyone can see your messages]`

Please listen carefully as I explain how to properly conduct room clearing.

We will be breaching rooms inside the facility. Starting at the max cells, then passing the showers, and ending at the max security yard.

These 2 lines represent the side of door you will stand on before breaching. You are expected to stay within your line while clearing.

We will stop at every door. Regardless of if it is opened or closed. We will not move onto the next door until everyone is properly in line.

I will lead you all and direct when to breach. Do not move past a door without my direction. Only the last person through should close the door.

The person at the back of the line is expected to cover everyone from any inmates or criminals. All inmates and criminals are kill on sight.

In the event you die please rejoin us at the maximum security yard.

Any questions? Yes/No, [Rank].

srlock room clearing.

Guns out!

BREACH!

h There is a session ongoing outside of the session room. Raiding it will result in punishment.

We are now moving onto the 1v1s phase! In this phase you and a fellow attendee will be using glock-17s to 1v1 eachother.

Your task here is simple, you will be called up pair by pair to 1v1 eachother.

On radio channel 2 I will say "READY!", "SET!", then "GO!". Once I say "GO!" the 1v1 can begin.

I will place you in a specific spot before your 1v1 begins. Do not move from this spot until you are told to begin.

Once complete you will go STS on the fence beside the SFL.

Understood? Yes/No, [Rank].

You may pair up with someone if you wish. If you want to pair with someone stand next to them in the line. Then we will begin the 1v1s once everyone is paired.

> `[Pair up those without a partner]`
> `[If there is an uneven amount of attendees a session admin or spectator can step in to 1v1]`

> `[Place pairs diagonally from eachother in the grass part of the max yard]`
> `[Start the "1v1s" phase on Bloxcord]`

**Instructor:** READY!
**Instructor:** AIM!!
**Instructor:** FIRE!

> `[After saying "FIRE!", team an attendee in the pair to inmate so they can damage eachother. They do not need to be refreshed but should be teamed back after their turn is complete.]`
