# **Moderation Information**
* Intelligence Agents, Community Management Associates, and Chief of Staff+ have the authority to punish users for the rules in this guide.
* Certain Intelligence Agency members can revert punishments issued by the Intelligence Agency if they have a valid reason.
* Certain Community Management members can revert punishments issued by Community Management if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ can revert punishments not issued under a department if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ and the Intelligence Agency can modify punishments if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ and the Intelligence Agency can make punishments unappealable if they have a valid reason.
* Chief of Staff+ and the Intelligence Agency can classify the reason and/or proof for a punishment if they have a valid reason.
* All ranks and departments are required to log punishments with valid proof.
* Mutes, Staff Warnings, Tool Bans, Game Bans [Excluding 5 Minute Ones], Rank Locks, Modcall Bans, Suspensions, Demotions, and Terminations can be appealed.
* Modified punishments do count towards that type of infraction [Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.].
  * Example: This means if someone gets a modified ban of 7 days and it is their first ban, the second ban should still be 3 days.
* Improper/Invalid punishments do not count towards normal infractions or infraction types [Chat Mute, Tool Ban, Game Ban, Etc.].
  * Even if the punishment is not yet reverted, this still applies. However, you are not required to ensure past punishments are correct, just as long as your punishment is correct based on the last correct punishment.
  * Invalid punishments should be reported to the Intelligence Agency once noticed if they are not reverted.
  * Example: This means if someone gets an unmodified punishment of a server ban for a tool abuse first infraction, you would ignore that punishment and issue a verbal warning for a tool abuse first infraction.
* LTAP punishments do not count towards a user's game ban infractions.
* If a user is demoted, suspended, or terminated, a rank-lock for the same length must be issued.
* For terminations, a permanent suspension must be issued instead of manually ranking to SSI.
* Rank locks only prevent rank claiming but do not prevent session promotions.
* You must log on Bloxcord and in Intel with your department unless you are punishing independently as an CoS+.
  * Example: Bypassing LOA (First Infraction) || SVCM.
* If logged on Bloxcord under a department, the punishment is no longer under the authority of IA but instead that department's high command.
* Reverted punishments that are not invalid still count towards the infraction count and the punishment infraction count.
* Users who break rules are allowed to know the reason and length of their punishment. They can also see the proof related to it.

# I - Reform Strategy & Initiatives

The following reforms outline the new ranks that reformed members will receive:
> Chief of Staff-Chairman of the Board --> Chief of Staff or Board of Governors
> Community Advisory Council-Board of Governors --> Community Advisory Council or Facility Director
> Chairperson-Facility Director --> Superintendent
> 
> Members can be issued a staff warning instead of being fully reformed.

The following factors listed below are what will be considered during the reform process:
> In-Game Activity
> Discord Activity
> Respect and Maturity
> Organizational Impact
> Community Rating

### Rank Purchases and Quota Excusal

Members who have purchased ranks or any form of quota excusal will still be subject to reforms when they occur. Forms of quota excusal will be taken into account during the reform process.

### Reform Appeals

You have the chance to appeal your reform within 72 hours of notice. Appeals must be well-thought-out and provide supporting evidence to show that you meet enough factors to not be reformed.
